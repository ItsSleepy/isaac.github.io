## Note for Developers

If you're setting up this portfolio locally, you'll need to add your own CV file as `CV.pdf` in this directory for the download functionality to work.

### Setup Instructions:

1. **Upload your CV**: Place your CV file here as `CV.pdf`
2. **File format**: PDF is recommended for best compatibility  
3. **File name**: Must be exactly `CV.pdf` for the download buttons to work
4. **File size**: Keep under 5MB for fast loading

### How it works:

- **Download button**: Downloads the CV file directly to user's device
- **View Online button**: Opens CV in a new browser tab
- **Navigation**: CV section is accessible via the navigation menu

### Current Status:
- ❌ CV.pdf - Not included in repository (add your own)
- ✅ Documents folder - Created and ready

**Note**: CV files are excluded from Git repositories to maintain privacy and keep repository size manageable.
