## 🔐 Security Notes

### Is the `anon` key safe to expose?
✅ **YES!** The `anon` (public) key is designed to be public. It's safe to:
- Include in your JavaScript code
- Commit to GitHub
- Share publicly

### How is it secure?
- **Row Level Security (RLS)** is enabled on all tables
- The `anon` key only allows **READ** access
- **WRITE** access requires authentication (admin panel)
- Your database password is never exposed

### "Supabase not initialized"
- ✅ Check that `config.js` has your correct URL and key
